We organized a workshop on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) inviting a bunch of people to give them a hands on experience on Google Cloud on the 7th of June 2014 in Hotel Royal Orchid, Bangalore.

**1. How was your experience as a Speaker at Google Cloud Workshop?**
This was my first experience as a speaker in GDG event and I can simply describe it in one word - AWESOME!!

**2. How was the response from the attendees?**
Attendees were a mixed crowd. One major problem I faced during the event was many attendees didn't came prepared i.e. they didn't had their machines preconfigured according to the instructions which were given earlier. This consumed some time during which more hands on experience was planned. One thing I liked about attendees was that they were very inquisitive. Their questions covered material which I was going to talk about in 4-5 slides ahead. This also created an atmosphere of curiosity to learn and think out of the box. Attendees from different careers and companies shared their experiences while asking questions, which helped in uncovering diverse application areas.

**3. What did you like the most during the event?**
Thing I like the most is the amount of energy, dedication and team work of GDG, GSA members to host the event successfully.I am very thankful to GDG Bangalore and Google to give me the opportunity of being a speaker. Thank you guys! GDG Bangalore rocks!

The most liked moment can be when attendees came forward and discuss their business problem to find the solution through Google app engine cloud platform and their willingness to know as much as possible.
