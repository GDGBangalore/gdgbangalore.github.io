We organized a workshop on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) inviting developers to give them a hands on experience with the Google Cloud Technology on the 7th of June 2014 at Hotel Royal Orchid, Bangalore.

**1. How was your experience as a Speaker at Google Cloud Workshop?**

This was my first experience as a speaker in a GDG event and I can simply describe it in one word - AWESOME!!

**2. How was the response from the attendees?**

Attendees were a mixed crowd. One of the problems I faced during the event was that many of the attendees were not prepared i.e. they didn't have their machines preconfigured according to the instructions which were given earlier. This consumed some time during which more hands on experience was planned. One thing I liked about the attendees was that they were very inquisitive. Their questions covered material which I was going to talk about 4-5 slides ahead. This also created an atmosphere of curiosity to learn and think out of the box. Attendees were from different careers and companies and they shared their experiences while asking questions, which helped in uncovering diverse application areas.

**3. What did you like the most during the event?**

The thing I liked the most was the amount of energy, dedication and team work of GDG and GSA members to host the event successfully. I am very thankful to GDG Bangalore and Google to give me the opportunity of being a speaker. Thank you guys! GDG Bangalore rocks!

**1. How was your experience as a Speaker at Google Cloud Workshop?**

It was a great experience all together as I got the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience being a part of the developer community of Google App Engine.

**2. How was the response from the attendees?**

The attendees asked quite a lot of technical questions and a variety of questions that made the session more interesting and an extensive exchange of knowledge about various challenges they were facing while implementing their solution on cloud and how Google App Engine could solve their concern.

**3. What did you like the most during the event?**

The moment I liked the most, was when attendees came forward and discussed their business problems to find the solution through Google App Engine cloud platform and their willingness to know as much as possible.
