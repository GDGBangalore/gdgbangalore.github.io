We conducted this meetup as a follow up of the Google I/O event. We focused on exploring the concepts of Ubiquitous programming and a discussion of web frameworks with Meteor as an example. The idea was to get in touch with developers and explore the eco-system that Google provides. The event was organized on 2nd August, 2014 at the Intel Campus, Bangalore.

**1. How was your experience as a speaker at the meetup?**

The experience was amazing. It was the first time I was speaking at an event related to Google. The event was very well organized, very well coordinated and was almost glitch free. It was a pleasure to be present at an event like this. 

**2. How much exposure do you think people have towards the concept of Ubiquitous programming and why?**

Ubiquitous Programming (quite an ambiguous name), is in very nascent stages. There is NO documentation yet, there are no fixed rules defined. We just see some small implementations of it in few places. Most of these implementations are cloud centric and don't tap in the potential and the power of devices local to us. This talk dealt with tapping of such resources and possible changes that can be made into our architectures, so that we exploit the power around us, rather than blindly depending on cloud all the time. Since this was a very nascent topic, a lot of audience seemed to have very less exposure. Also exposure to concepts like Service Oriented Architecture and Functional Programming was limited and hence I had to extemporaneously change the complexity of the presentation and touch upon basics .

**3. What did you like the most during the event ?**

Free Pizza :P .On a serious note, there wasn't anything much to complain about the event. I would have been happier if the audience consisted of more developers, more folks from the industry - it would have been more apt for an event of such kind.

**1. How was your experience as a speaker at the meetup?**

It was a very nice experience, being my first talk. Got to gain new experiences and how this can be proceeded further.

**2. How has been your experience with Meteor as compared to other frameworks ?**

Meteor framework is very easy to use. In comparison to other frameworks, web applications can easily be built using this framework. One just needs to understand the flow and everything else will be done by the framework.

**3. What did you like the most during the event?**

There is nothing that I can complain about. But, more number of experienced developers should be there. The event was pretty organised.
